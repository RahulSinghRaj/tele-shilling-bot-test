# Some Tips
Before the mute, TG system usually sends warning message.  
This tool will display those warnings.  
So some warning happens primarily based on spam / flood / etc,  
it is recommended to stop for a few moment and restart.


# FAQ
1. Spam / Flood warning message happens  

It is sign for the mute / ban,  
erase some shill group or increase 'SLEEP' value

Sometimes TG system applies the mute / ban without warning message.  
This can be caused by user report.  
As it cannot be avoided as there is no prior notice,  
I recommend you to erase more shill group and increase 'SLEEP' value


# DISCLAIMER
This is made for the shillers to shill more effectively and efficiently.  
Using too much in too much TG groups may lead unexpected results by the TG system. (ex. mute / ban)  
This tool is tested with many situation (Up to 50+ groups for 24+ hours)  
But it may differ because of the various slow mode cooldown for each group.

This tool has some safety methods to avoid it,
but this is not responsible for those unexpected results.
It is up to **YOU** to adjust using time and target group counts to avoid it.
