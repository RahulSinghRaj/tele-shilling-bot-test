# Introduction

### 🔥🔥🔥 ATTENTION ALL SHILLERS!! 🔥🔥🔥 
  
With this program,  
you can **SHILL** with **MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY** to more groups with **FREE** hands.  
Do other things! rest, play, or find more opportunities.  

For the launch event,
it will be **FREE** to use for all of you.  
Follow the instructions below.

When the time is right,  
**Fee will be charged** for future use.  
And you know that it is better to use this even if it charges fee,  
because you can earn more with powerful auto shilling :)  

# NOTICE
## Free Trial is not officially launched yet
Join https://t.me/AutoShillTG to get the launch announcement of this program for **FREE**.

# IMPORTANT
### DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT MENTIONED 
You may get **PERMANENT BAN** by the Telegram system if you do something which I didn't say.  


# Features
### Can shill with your user **ACCOUNT** (also can do with **BOT**)
### Can shill in multiple TG group  
tested for 120+ groups, but adjust yourself because of the TG spam system  
### **NOT** using your computer power (web version)  
You can also run this in your mobile too + turn on/off  
So if you have multiple account,  
you can do all this for multiple projects **WITHOUT LOSS OR ADDITIONAL LOAD** (web version)  
### Optimized msg resend time based on each group's **SLOW MODE**.  
I see many shilling services limit resend msg time like 60~120 seconds.  
This tool runs internal algorithm and regarding the slow mode timer,  
it automatically set optimized msg resend time for each group.  
(tested for no slow mode to 1h slow mode)  
### Add target groups with **GROUP LINK**. No need for **GROUP ID**, etc.  
### **NO INSTALLATION NEEDED**
### Automatically joins the group if listed group is not joined  
Only few group can be joined per day due to TG spam system  
### And many more, just focusing on spreading this tool now.

6. **Enjoy 24/7 Shilling :)**

+ Some people reported that web provided by google consistently checks activity of the user  
If this happens, runtime will be closed with popup message.
But you can ignore captcha msgs.  
But you may need to stop and play the last button in **6 HOURS** due to account based activity checking system.  
So if you think this is happening to you,  
do below process.  
start the last play button - (around before 6 hours) - stop the last play button - start the last play button - (repeat)

# Some Tips
Before the mute, TG system usually sends warning message.  
This tool will display those warnings.  
So some warning happens primarily based on spam / flood / etc,  
it is recommended to stop for a few moment and restart.


# FAQ
warning msgs below should restart the runtime  
databased is locked  


1. Spam / Flood warning message happens  

It is sign for the mute / ban,  
erase some shill group or increase 'SLEEP' value

Sometimes TG system applies the mute / ban without warning message.  
This can be caused by user report.  
As it cannot be avoided as there is no prior notice,  
I recommend you to erase more shill group and increase 'SLEEP' value


# DISCLAIMER
This is made for the shillers to shill more effectively and efficiently.  
If you use too much in too much TG groups with too much accounts,
it may lead unexpected results by the TG system. (ex. mute / ban)  
This tool is tested with many situations.  
(Up to 130+ groups for 24+ hours)  
But it may differ because of the various slow mode cooldown for each group.
+ many environment / situation of your account / computer

This tool has some safety methods to avoid it,  
but this is not responsible for those unexpected results.  
It is up to **YOU** to adjust using time and target group counts to avoid it.
